# CommonLit Readability Kaggle competition 2021
This repository contains the winning algorithm code from Mathis Lucka ([GitHub](https://github.com/mathislucka), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mathislucka)), although I have made some changes to the code. 

As part of my research assistantship at Georgia State University, I was responsible for reproducing the winning algorithms. This involved calculating metrics, editing for ease of reproducibility, and writing up results.

Please email me if you are interested in my work or would like to know more about this project. Link to the [original Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/commonlitreadabilityprize/discussion/257844)
